Comparing the efficiency of the following.
-> Naive Solutions : segments of 2 and 3 
-> Hamming Codes:  (7,4) and (15,11) 
-> Golay Code: extended binary and perfect binary

These are just possible comparisions, we can cut stuff out based on how hard it is to find code 

Extended Golay code currently in the first branch - with randomised input for testing
